        <h2>Diagram</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This is a diagram of New Zealand with 20m of sea level rise, this is set to happen by 2300 if climate change keeps up as It is currently. You can see that the majority of Auckland is Completely underwater. Christchurch is also mostly underwater, these would strongly affect New Zealand as together they have nearly half of the population of New Zealand, this would mean that nearly half the population would have to pack up and move further inland. This would also lead to a housing crisis and many other issues in society. The places that are the most affected are Auckland, Dunedin and Christchurch. Auckland would be absolutely devastated as over 50% of the land is within 30m of current sea level, another reason Auckland would be devastated is because it is no longer connected to the mainland, therefore it would be harder to get further down the country. Christchurch is affected as it over 30% of the land is within 30m of sea level, near Christchurch is Banks Peninsula which would become an island, you can see it is not connected to the mainland on the map. Dunedin would be affected as it has nearly been wiped off the map completely, Dunedin is home to over 120,000 people and nearly all those people would have to move inland to avoid the rising sea levels .
            <br>
            Overall almost 2/3 of people in New Zealand would be displaced.

        <h2>What you can do</h2><br>
        <p>There are many levels to your contribution to helping stop climate change, even picking up a piece of plastic helps. Here are 3 Things easy things you can do to help <br><br>

            1.
            <br>
            Get together with your community to do a gardening event
            You can easily get your community together to do a gardening event! Places to do these are in reserves and gardens all around New Zealand, such as the Botanical Gardens in Auckland. Getting people together is the hard part, to do this you can post your event on places like <a href="https://www.neighbourly.co.nz">https://www.neighbourly.co.nz</a>, or you can do it by posting flyers into your neighbours letterboxes.
            <br>
            <br>

            2.<br>
            Support Climate Change
            You can support climate change by donating money to charities such as WWF <a href="https://www.wwf.org.nz/what_we_do/climateaction/">https://www.wwf.org.nz/what_we_do/climateaction/</a> or you can support climate change by turning up to events and showing support to the people in your community who are organising these events. <br><br>


            3.<br>
            Turn off electronics
            I left the simplest for last, Turn lights and electronics off when you are not using them, all you have to do is flick a switch or take them out of the socket, if everyone did this then we would save nearly Â¼ of the total energy used all year by everyone on the globe.<br><br>
